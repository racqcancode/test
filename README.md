#The Family Flyer#

<p>This project is authored by Claire Helland, Jacqueline De Guzman, and Racquel Tung.  We programmed an HTML email newsletter to encourage families, especially those with younger children, to travel together.

<p>After our image header, our first feature was our destination of the moment:  Paris, France.  The button routes the user to an external article about the city of lights.

<p>This opening section is followed by 3 areas of content:
<ul>
<li>Highlighted social media accounts of traveling families</li>
<li>Hopeful parent hacks for flying with young children</li>
<li>Helpful tips on how to turn credit card points into a discounted (or free) vacation</li></ul>

<p>We have embedded links to real social media accounts and external web articles.

<p>It was a challenging, yet rewarding pleasure to prepare this for our Cohort-mates!  As we are all new to this, we look forward to and appreciate your input on how to improve our skills for future projects.
