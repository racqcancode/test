#The Family Flyer#

<p>This project is authored by Claire Helland, Jacqueline De Guzman, and Racquel Tung.  Together, we programmed an HTML email newsletter to inspire families to travel together.

<p>After our image header, our first feature was our destination of the moment:  Paris, France.

<p>This opening section is followed by 3 areas of content:
<ul>
<li>Featured social media accounts of traveling families
<li>Parent hacks for flying with young children
<li>Tips on how to make your credit card points finance your vacation
</ul>

<p>We have embedded links to real social media accounts and external web articles.

<p>It was a challenging, yet rewarding pleasure to prepare this for our Cohort-mates!  As we are all new to this, we look forward to and appreciate your input on how to improve our skills for future projects.
